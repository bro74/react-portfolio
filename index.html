            <article class = "bio">
                    <p>I am not a backend developer at this momemt and this was the wrong season to take part in this course. I learned a lot of other non-coding items along side some css development. I am definitely a writer and theorizer who experienced some paralyzing fear of embarssement with needing help, because they could not keep up with course pace. I can do, I just take an excruciating long time to move through a module, and didnt feel very comfortable in the classroom. Part-time, could've and should've. </p>
